# Data File Description

This datafile is a summary of the 2015 Intercensal Survey, aggregated at the borough level by *household*. Each statistic represents the characteristics of the average *household* in the respective borough.

The microdata is harmonized and cleaned by the Minnesota Population Center via IPUMS International and I have uploaded here my processed files. For most indicators, I first created binary variables based on the original IPUMS dataset (for instance, coding 0 for a household if it had less than 2.5 persons per room, and 1 if it had more). From these binary variables, I summarized the dataset and created borough-level indicators using the household survey weights provided by IPUMS.
